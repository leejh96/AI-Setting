prompt = """
Act as a senior developer writing a git commit message.
Follow these rules (Conventional Commits):
1. Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
2. Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
3. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
4. Keep the subject line under 50 characters if possible.

Here are the staged changes you are committing:
---
!{bash -c 'git diff --cached --ignore-all-space -- . ":(exclude)package-lock.json" ":(exclude)yarn.lock"'}
---

If there are no staged changes, ask the user to stage files first.
